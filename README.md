Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a crucial role in understanding genomic datasets, identifying patterns, and uncovering insights before applying predictive modeling. 

This project focuses on Advanced EDA techniques applied to genomic data, ensuring a comprehensive structure, quality assessment, and feature exploration. 

The analysis is implemented as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to dynamically explore and visualize the data.
